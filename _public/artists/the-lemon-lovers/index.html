                    <p>From Porto, Portugal, <i>The Lemon Lovers</i> was started by Jo√£o Pedro Silva and Victor Butuc in 2012.</p>

<p>Their first EP ‚Äî <b>Hangover</b>, was recorded in a basement for three days in April 2013. Following the release, for two years, the band had the chance to play their music all around Portugal.</p>

<p>Many songs were written during the tour and in 2015 their debut album <b>Loud, Sexy & Rude</b> came out. Recorded and mixed at Reno Studios in Madrid with the mentoring of Bra√≠s Gonz√°lez. The mastering, by Brian Lucey (who worked with Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys), took place at Magic Garden Studios, in Los Angeles.</p>

<p><i>The 55</i> and <i>No Shoes</i> were the first two singles, with both music videos directed by Vasco Mendes. <i>No Shoes</i> was featured in <em>New Portuguese Talents</em> by Fnac Portugal and won the <em>best music video of 2016</em> by the media outlet P√∫blico P3.</p>

<p>Between 2015 and 2016, The Lemon Lovers did <i>The 55 Bus Tour</i> and <i>Lost in Vis√©grad Tour</i> on over 40 stages, throughout 12 countries, in less than 60 days. They had the chance to grow their fanbase and play for a wider audience. Following that, their second record came to life ‚Äî <b>Watching the Dancers</b>, recorded and mixed entirely onto analog tape by Jo√£o Brand√£o, and mastered by Miguel Pinheiro Marques at Est√∫dios S√° da Bandeira in Porto, Portugal.</p>

<p>2017 came with their third European tour, with more than 30 shows in Europe (Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Poland, and Czech Republic).</p>

<p>In 2018 they released <i>half blind</i>, a single that reached <em>over 90.000 views</em> on YouTube. They played major festivals like Vodafone Paredes de Coura and Festival Bons Sons. In 2019 they released another single called <i>one night stand</i>.</p>

<p>During the pandemic situation of 2020 the third album was finished. To be released in September 2021, their self-titled <b>The Lemon Lovers</b>, will be accompanied by a theater tour in Portugal.</p>
